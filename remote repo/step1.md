In this step, we will simulate two different developers working in different environments, each one with his own local repo

## Start

First step, we will clone an existing repository:
`git clone https://github.com/alepironi/hello-world.git`{{execute}}


Let's do some modification to the file `hello-world/README.md`{{open}}

now we can commit 
`git add .`{execute}

`git commit -m "added lines to README file" `{execute}

`git push`{execute}
