## Developer 1

Let's change the file.

Now we are ready to push our changes to the remote repository. The first time you clone a repository, you have to configure who you are in order to push changes around:

`git config user.email dev1@mycompany.com`{{execute}}

`git config user.name "developer1"`{{execute}}


`git add .`{{execute}}

`git commit -m "changes from developer 1"`{{execute}}

`git push`{{execute}}
