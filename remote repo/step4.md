## Developer 2

Now also developer 2 makes some change in his own folder...

... and wants to push it to the remote repository.

`git config user.email dev2@mycompany.com`{{execute}}

`git config user.name "developer2"`{{execute}}

`git add .`{{execute}}

`git commit -m "changes from developer 2"`{{execute}}

`git push`{{execute}}

**Push fails because of a conflict**
